-To detect signs of potential addiction based on behavior.
-To explore relationships between social media time and:
    .Academic performance
    .Sleep duration
    .Stress or anxiety levels
    .Social relationships
-To visualize the findings using Python libraries.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies
-Language: Python
-Libraries Used:
    .pandas for data handling

    .numpy for numerical analysis


🔍 Key Analysis
-Correlation between social media usage and academic performance.
-Scatter plots for Usage vs Sleep, Usage vs Academic Score, etc.
-Pie charts for platform preference.
-Histograms to show frequency of daily usage.

✅ Conclusion
